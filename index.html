				<h2><i>Hidden Costs to Avoid</i></h2>
					<p>Make sure before booking anything that you see what all is included in the fare. Look for any extras like insurance, baggage fees, or other costs you can avoid having to pay. Verify if your credit card had travel insurance included when you use your card to pay for travel. Also try using a credit card that offer bonus rewards when you use it. </p>

					<p>Set aside any money leftover from your paychecks. If you can't then you can sell some items you no longer need on ebay, FaceBook Marketplace, Offer Up, or other selling apps. You can also sell some items at the pawn shop. </p>
